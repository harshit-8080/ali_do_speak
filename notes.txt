--> Till here 

        1.  We have learned about http connection. which is over tcp
        2.  and as we know in http connection, client make a request and server send the response and connection breaks.


--> what if we need bi directional communication

        1.  wehere anyone can make a request and anyone send a response


--> So web socket allows use fo bi directional communication  ( pipeline setup in web sockets )

        1.  Web socket also use tcp connection
        2.  It's reliable
        3.  node js has socket.io libray for implementation of web socket
        4.  ror has active channel for the same.

        5. socket.io has the best documentation.

        6. We will little bit of frontend also, not react just dom functions.

        7. It gives us a event based architecture.
            1.  What is event based architecture, Whenever you have to do something you emit an event.
            
            2.  And other end we consume an event.
            
            3.  Let's understand what is events in node js
                ---> check github and start event theory and code.

            4.   after that setup the basic express js project 

            5. install socket.io ==> npm i socket.io   

            6. make a public folder and index.html file inside that.

            7. To server some static file like html file we need to use middleware
                app.use("/", express.static(__dirname + "/public"));

            8. start project and go to ==> http://localhost:3000/  

            9. now go to socket.io/get-started/chat  

            10. Now do what ever in documentation
                ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
                        const http = require('http');
                        const server = http.createServer(app);
                        const { Server } = require("socket.io");
                        const io = new Server(server);

                        server.listen(3000);
                //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 

            11. now Go to --> http://localhost:3000/socket.io/socket.io.js
